# Design-Bench

Design-Bench is a **benchmarking framework** for solving automatic design problems that involve choosing an input that maximizes a black-box function. This type of optimization is used across scientific and engineering disciplines in ways such as designing proteins and DNA sequences with particular functions, chemical formulas and molecule substructures, the morphology and controllers of robots, and many more applications. 

These applications have significant potential to accelerate research in biochemistry, chemical engineering, materials science, robotics and many other disciplines. We hope this framework serves as a robust platform to drive these applications and create widespread excitement for model-based optimization.

## Offline Model-Based Optimization

![Offline Model-Based Optimization](https://storage.googleapis.com/design-bench/mbo.png)

The goal of model-based optimization is to find an input **x** that maximizes an unknown black-box function **f**. This function is frequently difficulty or costly to evaluate---such as requiring wet-lab experiments in the case of protein design. In these cases, **f** is described by a set of function evaluations: D = {(x_0, y_0), (x_1, y_1), ... (x_n, y_n)}, and optimization is performed without querying **f** on new data points.

## Installation

Design-Bench can be installed with the complete set of benchmarks via our pip package.

```bash
conda create -n mbo -c conda-forge rdkit
pip install design-bench[all]==2.0.20
pip install morphing-agents==1.5.1
```

Alternatively, if you do not have MuJoCo, you may opt for a minimal install.

```bash
conda create -n mbo -c conda-forge rdkit
pip install design-bench==2.0.20
```

## Available Tasks

## Performance Of Baselines

We benchmark a set of 9 methods for solving offline model-based optimization problems. Performance is reported in normalized form, where the 100th percentile score of 128 candidate designs is evaluated and normalized such that a 1.0 corresponds to performance equivalent to the best performing design in the *full unobserved* dataset assoctated with each model-based optimization task. A 0.0 corresponds to performance equivalent to the worst performing design in the *full unobserved* dataset. In circumstances where an exact oracle is not available, this *full unobserved* dataset is used for training the approximate oracle that is used for evaluation of candidate designs proposed by each method. The symbol ± indicates the empirical standard deviation of reported performance across 8 trials.

## Reproducing Baseline Performance

In order to reproduce this table, you must first install the implementation of the baseline algorithms.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/brandontrabucco/design-baselines
conda env create -f design-baselines/environment.yml
conda activate design-baselines
```

You may then run the following series of commands in a bash terminal using the command-line interface exposed in design-baselines. Also, please ensure that the conda environment `design-baselines` is activated in the bash session that you run these commands from in order to access the `design-baselines` command-line interface.

```

These commands will run several model-based optimization algorithms (such as [CbAS](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v97/brookes19a.html)) contained in design-baselines on all tasks released with the design-bench benchmark, and will then generate three performance tables from those results, and print a latex rendition of these performance tables to stdout.

## The Train-Test Discrepency

For tasks where an exact numerical ground truth is not available for evaluating the performance of previously unseen candidate designs, we provide several families of approximate oracle models that have been trained using a larger *held out* dataset of designs x and corresponding scores y.

Using a learned oracle for evaluation and training an MBO method using real data creates a train-test discrepency. This discrepency can be avoided by *relabelling* the y values in an offline MBO dataset with the predictions of the learned oracle, which is controlled by the following parameter when building a task.

```python
import design_bench

# instantiate the task using y values generated from the learned oracle
task = design_bench.make('GFP-Transformer-v0', relabel=True)

# instantiate the task using y values generated from real experiments
task = design_bench.make('GFP-Transformer-v0', relabel=False)
```

## Task API

Design-Bench tasks share a common interface specified in **design_bench/task.py**, which exposes a set of input designs **task.x** and a set of output predictions **task.y**. In addition, the performance of a new set of input designs (such as those output from a model-based optimization algorithm) can be found using **y = task.predict(x)**.

```python
import design_bench
task = design_bench.make('TFBind8-Exact-v0')

def solve_optimization_problem(x0, y0):
    return x0  # solve a model-based optimization problem

# solve for the best input x_star and evaluate it
x_star = solve_optimization_problem(task.x, task.y)
y_star = task.predict(x_star)
```

Many datasets of interest to practitioners are too large to load in memory all at once, and so the task interface defines an several iterables that load samples from the dataset incrementally.
 
 ```python
import design_bench
task = design_bench.make('TFBind8-Exact-v0')

for x, y in task:
    pass  # train a model here
    
for x, y in task.iterate_batches(32):
    pass  # train a model here
    
for x, y in task.iterate_samples():
    pass  # train a model here
 ```
 
Certain optimization algorithms require a particular input format, and so tasks support normalization of both **task.x** and **task.y**, as well as conversion of **task.x** from discrete tokens to the logits of a categorical probability distribution---needed when optimizing **x** with a gradient-based model-based optimization algorithm.
 
 ```python
import design_bench
task = design_bench.make('TFBind8-Exact-v0')

# convert x to logits of a categorical probability distribution
task.map_to_logits()
discrete_x = task.to_integers(task.x)

# normalize the inputs to have zero mean and unit variance
task.map_normalize_x()
original_x = task.denormalize_x(task.x)

# normalize the outputs to have zero mean and unit variance
task.map_normalize_y()
original_y = task.denormalize_y(task.y)

# remove the normalization applied to the outputs
task.map_denormalize_y()
normalized_y = task.normalize_y(task.y)

# remove the normalization applied to the inputs
task.map_denormalize_x()
normalized_x = task.normalize_x(task.x)

# convert x back to integers
task.map_to_integers()
continuous_x = task.to_logits(task.x)
 ```
 
Each task provides access to the model-based optimization dataset used to learn the oracle (where applicable) as well as the oracle itself, which includes metadata for how it was trained (where applicable). These provide fine-grain control over the data distribution for model-based optimization.
 
 ```python
import design_bench
task = design_bench.make('GFP-GP-v0')

# an instance of the DatasetBuilder class from design_bench.datasets.dataset_builder
dataset = task.dataset

# modify the distribution of the task dataset
dataset.subsample(max_samples=10000, 
                   distribution="uniform",
                   min_percentile=10, 
                   max_percentile=90)

# an instance of the OracleBuilder class from design_bench.oracles.oracle_builder
oracle = task.oracle

# check how the model was fit
print(oracle.params["rank_correlation"],
       oracle.params["model_kwargs"],
       oracle.params["split_kwargs"])
 ```

## Dataset API

Datasets provide a model-based optimization algorithm with information about the black-box function, and are used in design bench to fit approximate oracle models when an exact oracle is not available. All datasets inherit from the DatasetBuilder class defined in *design_bench.datasets.dataset_builder*.

All datasets implement methods for modifying the format and distribution of the dataset, including normalization, subsampling, relabelling the outputs, and (for discrete datasets) converting discrete inputs to real-valued. There are also special methods for splitting the dataset into a training and validation set.

If you would like to define your own dataset for use with design-bench, you can directly instantiate a continuous dataset or a discrete dataset depending on the input format you are using. The DiscreteDataset class and ContinuousDataset are built with this in mind, and accept both two numpy arrays containing inputs *x* outputs *y*.

<details>

<summary>Display code snippet</summary>

```python
from design_bench.datasets.discrete_dataset import DiscreteDataset
from design_bench.datasets.continuous_dataset import ContinuousDataset
import numpy as np

# create dummy inputs and outputs for model-based optimization
x = np.random.randint(500, size=(5000, 43))
y = np.random.uniform(size=(5000, 1))

# create a discrete dataset for those inputs and outputs
dataset = DiscreteDataset(x, y)

# create dummy inputs and outputs for model-based optimization
x = np.random.uniform(size=(5000, 871))
y = np.random.uniform(size=(5000, 1))

# create a continuous dataset for those inputs and outputs
dataset = ContinuousDataset(x, y)
```

</details>

In the event that you are using a dataset that is saved to a set of sharded numpy files (ending in .npy), you may also create dataset by providing a list of shard files representing using the DiskResource class. The DiscreteDataset class and ContinuousDataset accept two lists of sharded inputs *x* and outputs *y* represented by DiskResource objects.

# list the disk resource for each shard
os.makedirs("new_dataset/")
x = [DiskResource("new_dataset/shard-x-0.npy"), 
     DiskResource("new_dataset/shard-x-1.npy")]
y = [DiskResource("new_dataset/shard-y-0.npy"), 
     DiskResource("new_dataset/shard-y-1.npy")]

# create dummy inputs and outputs for model-based optimization

## Oracle API

Oracles provide a way of measuring the performance of candidate solutions to a model-based optimization problem, found by a model-based optimization algorithm, without having to perform additional real-world experiments. To this end, oracle implement a prediction function **oracle.predict(x)** that takes a set of designs and makes a prediction about their performance. The goal of model-based optimization is to maximize the predictions of the oracle.

```python
from design_bench.datasets.discrete.gfp_dataset import GFPDataset
from design_bench.oracles.tensorflow import TransformerOracle

# create a dataset and a noisy oracle
dataset = GFPDataset()
oracle = TransformerOracle(dataset, noise_std=0.1)

def solve_optimization_problem(x0, y0):
    return x0  # solve a model-based optimization problem

# evaluate the performance of the solution x_star
x_star = solve_optimization_problem(dataset.x, dataset.y)
y_star = oracle.predict(x_star)
```

</details>

In order to handle when an exact ground truth is unknown or not tractable to evaluate, Design-Bench provides a set of approximate oracles including a Gaussian Process, Random Forest, and several deep neural network architectures specialized to particular data modalities. These approximate oracles may have the following parameters.

```

## Defining New MBO Tasks

New model-based optimization tasks are simple to create and register with design-bench. By subclassing either DiscreteDataset or ContinuousDataset, and providing either a pair of numpy arrays containing inputs and outputs, or a pair of lists of DiskResource shards containing inputs and outputs, you can define your own model-based optimization dataset class. Once a custom dataset class is created, you can register it as a model-based optimization task by choosing an appropriate oracle type, and making a call to the register function. After doing so, subsequent calls to **design_bench.make** can find your newly registered model-based optimization task.
